<p><a href="marginsnotes/index.html">Marginal Effects</a>: A long-form
document on using marginal effects (marginal means and marginal slopes)
to improve interpretation of regression coefficients, especially in the
presence of an interaction. Presents as a Rosetta stone for Stata’s
<code>margins</code> command and R. <em>Software</em>: Stata and R.</p>
<p><a
href="https://josherrickson.shinyapps.io/benj_hoch/">Benjamini–Hochberg
Procedure</a>: An interactive calculator to apply the Benjamini–Hochberg
multiple comparison correction for a series of p-values.</p>
<p><a href="logtransform.html">Interpreting log
transformations in regression</a>: Interpreting coefficients from a
linear regression model (or linear mixed model) when the predictor
and/or the outcome have been log transformed. <em>Software</em>: R,
though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="mixedModelsSPSS.html">Random intercepts in
SPSS’s Mixed Model</a>: There are two ways of specifying random
intercepts in SPSS’s Mixed Model; this discusses their equivalence.
<em>Software</em>: SPSS.</p>
<p><a href="moderationMediation.html">Moderation and
Mediation via Regression</a>: Although moderation and mediation
typically arise in SEM/path analysis frameworks, moderation can be
addressed in regression, and mediation can be conceptualized through
regression.</p>
<p><a href="iccirr.html">IRR and ICC</a>: Some notes on IRR
versus ICC, as well as how to obtain the ICC. <em>Software</em>: R,
though concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="visualizeCollinearity.html">The issue of
collinear predictors</a>: A visualization to see the potential negative
effect of including highly collinear variables in a model.
<em>Software</em>: R, though concepts could transfer to other
software.</p>
<p><a href="xtsetvsmixed.html">Stata, <code>xt</code> versus
mixed model</a>: Econometricians usually use the <code>xt</code>
framework to address repeated measures. This document shows how to fit
the equivalent of fixed effects regression, between effects regression,
and random effects regression using linear regression
(<code>regress</code>) and linear mixed models (<code>mixed</code>).
<em>Software</em>: Stata.</p>
<p><a href="vizrandomeffects.html">Nested versus crossed
random effects</a>: Multiple random effects in a mixed model are
typically defined as either “nested” or “crossed”. This document shows
that this is a false dichotomy (nested random effects aren’t real!), as
well as showing some nice visualization. <em>Software</em>: R, though
concepts could transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="splinesvsinteraction.html">Linear splines versus
interactions</a>: Models such as interrupted time series or diff-in-diff
are often considered special analyses. This document attempts to show
that these are just regression models with particular interactions.
<em>Software</em>: Stata, though concepts could transfer to other
software.</p>
<p><a href="randomselection.html">Selecting a random subset
of the data, potentially within subgroups</a>: An easy way to generate a
random sample of your data of arbitrary size, including a stratified
approach. <em>Software</em>: Stata, though concepts could transfer to
other software.</p>
<p><a href="svy_gsem_teffects.html">Mediation with Survey
data</a>: To fit a mediation model in Stata using complex survey data
requires using <code>gsem</code>. Unfortunately, the <code>gsem</code>
command does not support directly estimating direct, indirect and total
effects. This documents how to compute them. <em>Software</em>:
Stata.</p>
<p><a href="divideby4.html">The “Divide by 4” rule</a>: An
additional tool in interpreting logistic regression coefficients is the
“Divide by 4” rule. <em>Software</em>: Stata, though concepts could
transfer to other software.</p>
<p><a href="responsesurfaceplot.html">Response Surface Model
Plotting</a>: An example of visualization after running a “response
surface model”, aka just regression with an interaction.
<em>Software</em>: R.</p>
<p><a href="modifying_stata_builtin.html">Modifying
built-in-Stata commands</a>: A fun story about hacking one of Stata’s
shipped-with commands to make some code work. A story rather than a
guide or instructions. <em>Software</em>: Stata.</p>
