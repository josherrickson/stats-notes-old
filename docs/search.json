    "text": "One way to think about random intercepts in a mixed models is the impact they will have on the residual covariance matrix. Of course, in a model with only fixed effects (e.g. lm), the residual covariance matrix is diagonal as each observation is assumed independent. In mixed models, there is a dependence structure across observations, so the residual covariance matrix will no longer be diagonal.\n\n\nWhether random effects are nested or crossed1 is a property of the data, not the model. However, when fitting the model, effects can be included as either nested or crossed.\nNested random effects are when each member of one group is contained entirely within a single unit of another group. The canonical example is students in classrooms; you may have repeated measures per student, but each student belongs to a single classroom (assuming no reassignments).\nCrossed random effects are when this nesting is not true. An example would be different seeds and different fields used for planting crops. Seeds of the same type can be planted in different fields, and each field can have multiple seeds in it."
